# Points_of_intersection_between_2_equations
GUI in MATLAB that takes 2 equations of some order and calculates the point of intersection between the equations (solutions).

In my undergraduate degree I did a project that requires building a GUI and finding all the intersections between 2 functions and some interesting features.
